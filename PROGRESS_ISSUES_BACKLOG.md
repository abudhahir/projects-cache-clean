# ðŸ“‹ Progress Implementation Issues Backlog

## Issue #1: Race Condition Vulnerability
**Priority:** CRITICAL  
**Category:** Security  

**Issue Details:**
Global mutable state `globalCleanupState` is accessed concurrently by multiple goroutines without proper synchronization. The current mutex implementation only protects individual field writes but not compound operations, creating race condition windows where:
- Multiple cleanup sessions can overwrite each other's state
- Timer goroutine can read partially updated state
- Memory corruption can occur during state reinitialization
- Application crashes and unpredictable behavior are possible

**Implementation Hint:**
Replace global state with encapsulated state within the Bubble Tea model. Use message passing instead of shared memory. Implement proper atomic operations for compound state updates.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] No global mutable state variables
- [ ] All state managed within Bubble Tea model
- [ ] Concurrent access through message passing only
- [ ] Race condition detection tests pass
- [ ] Multiple cleanup sessions work independently

## Issue #2: Memory Leak from Uncleaned Timers
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Category:** Resource Management  

**Issue Details:**
The `tea.Every(200*time.Millisecond)` timer continues running indefinitely after cleanup completion. Multiple cleanup sessions create multiple timers that are never cleaned up, leading to:
- Resource exhaustion over time
- Increased CPU usage and battery drain
- Timer goroutines consuming memory
- No mechanism to stop abandoned timers

**Implementation Hint:**
Use context-based cancellation with `context.WithCancel()`. Store timer cancellation functions in the model and call them on cleanup completion or user cancellation. Implement proper defer cleanup patterns.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] All timers have explicit cleanup mechanisms
- [ ] Timer stops immediately when cleanup completes
- [ ] Timer stops when user cancels operation
- [ ] No goroutine leaks after cleanup sessions
- [ ] Memory usage remains constant across multiple cleanups

## Issue #3: Null Pointer Dereference Risk
**Priority:** MEDIUM  
**Category:** Security  

**Issue Details:**
Race condition exists between null check and mutex lock on `globalCleanupState`. The state can become nil between the check and the lock acquisition, causing potential panics:
```go
if globalCleanupState == nil { return nil }
// Race condition window here
globalCleanupState.mutex.RLock() // PANIC if nil
```

**Implementation Hint:**
Eliminate global state to remove this issue entirely. If global state must be used, implement atomic pointer operations or use sync.Once for initialization patterns.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] No null pointer dereference possibilities
- [ ] Safe concurrent access to all state
- [ ] Application never panics during normal operation
- [ ] Stress tests with concurrent operations pass

## Issue #4: Anti-Pattern Global State Management
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Category:** Architecture  

**Issue Details:**
Using global mutable state violates clean architecture principles and creates multiple problems:
- Breaks encapsulation and data hiding
- Makes unit testing impossible (state pollution between tests)
- Violates single responsibility principle
- Creates tight coupling between components
- Makes reasoning about code flow difficult

**Implementation Hint:**
Refactor to use proper Bubble Tea model state management. Move all cleanup state into the model struct. Use message passing for communication between components. Implement dependency injection for testability.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] No global variables for application state
- [ ] All state encapsulated in appropriate structs
- [ ] Components can be unit tested independently
- [ ] Clear data flow through message passing
- [ ] Dependency injection enables mocking for tests

## Issue #5: Incorrect Bubble Tea Pattern Usage
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Category:** Architecture  

**Issue Details:**
The implementation mixes imperative state management with Bubble Tea's declarative model, violating framework patterns:
- Polling external state instead of using message passing
- Mixing goroutines with Bubble Tea's command system
- Not following the model-update-view cycle properly
- Creating side effects outside of commands

**Implementation Hint:**
Study Bubble Tea examples and refactor to use proper command chaining. Replace polling with event-driven updates. Use `tea.Cmd` return values for state changes. Implement proper message types for each operation.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Follows Bubble Tea's model-update-view pattern correctly
- [ ] No external state polling
- [ ] All state changes through message handling
- [ ] Commands are pure and side-effect free
- [ ] Framework patterns match official examples

## Issue #6: Fake Progress Calculation
**Priority:** MEDIUM  
**Category:** Functionality  

**Issue Details:**
Progress calculation uses simple array index division instead of actual work completion, resulting in misleading progress indicators:
- Large projects show same progress increment as small projects
- User sees "40% complete" but 90% of actual work remains
- No consideration of file sizes or operation complexity
- Progress jumps erratically instead of smooth progression

**Implementation Hint:**
Calculate progress based on actual work units (bytes processed, files handled). Pre-calculate total work size. Update progress based on cumulative work completed rather than simple counters.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Progress reflects actual work completion percentage
- [ ] Large projects don't skew progress calculation
- [ ] Smooth progress progression without erratic jumps
- [ ] Progress matches user's perceived completion time
- [ ] Progress calculation is mathematically accurate

## Issue #7: Missing Operation Cancellation
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Category:** Functionality  

**Issue Details:**
No mechanism exists to cancel cleanup operations once started:
- User cannot abort dangerous operations
- No graceful shutdown during application exit
- Operations continue even if UI is closed
- No way to stop runaway cleanup processes

**Implementation Hint:**
Implement context-based cancellation using `context.WithCancel()`. Add cancel button to UI. Handle context cancellation in cleanup loops. Provide user feedback for cancellation actions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] User can cancel cleanup operations at any time
- [ ] Cancellation is immediate and graceful
- [ ] Partial work is properly cleaned up on cancel
- [ ] UI shows cancellation feedback
- [ ] Application exits cleanly with ongoing operations cancelled

## Issue #8: No Error Handling During Cleanup
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Category:** Reliability  

**Issue Details:**
Cleanup operations have no error handling, leading to inconsistent state:
- Failed `removeCacheItems` calls are ignored
- State becomes inconsistent with reality
- User receives incorrect completion reports
- No retry mechanisms for transient failures

**Implementation Hint:**
Add comprehensive error handling around all cleanup operations. Track failed operations separately. Provide user feedback for errors. Implement retry logic for recoverable failures.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] All cleanup operations have error handling
- [ ] Failed operations are reported to user
- [ ] State remains consistent even with errors
- [ ] Retry mechanisms for transient failures
- [ ] Detailed error reporting and logging

## Issue #9: Resource Management Failure
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Category:** Resource Management  

**Issue Details:**
No cleanup mechanism exists for background resources:
- Timers are never stopped
- Goroutines are never cleaned up
- Mutex locks may be held indefinitely
- Memory usage grows with each operation

**Implementation Hint:**
Implement proper resource cleanup patterns with defer statements. Use context for lifecycle management. Track all resources that need cleanup. Add resource cleanup to all exit paths.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] All resources have explicit cleanup
- [ ] Cleanup occurs on all exit paths (success, error, cancel)
- [ ] No resource leaks detectable in memory profiling
- [ ] Goroutines are properly terminated
- [ ] Clean shutdown under all conditions

## Issue #10: Hardcoded Performance Parameters
**Priority:** LOW  
**Category:** Performance  

**Issue Details:**
Timer interval and other performance parameters are hardcoded without justification:
- 200ms interval may be too frequent for large operations
- No consideration for battery usage on mobile devices
- No adaptation to operation complexity
- Magic numbers without documentation

**Implementation Hint:**
Make timer intervals configurable. Implement adaptive timing based on operation complexity. Add performance configuration options. Document timing decisions and trade-offs.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Timer intervals are configurable
- [ ] Performance parameters are documented
- [ ] Adaptive timing based on operation size
- [ ] Battery-friendly defaults for mobile platforms
- [ ] Performance tuning options available
